/*
 The following rules are used to better display <details> elements in Internet
 Explorer and Edge, as they are currently unsupported. A JavaScript polyfill
 is used to add functionality, however the following rules ensure to remove
 some other issues.

 1. border: 0;
    This is used as these browsers do not correctly calculate the position of
    the element, and the border displays as a vertical line beside the element.
    This removes the border completely.

 2. background-color: $gray-lighter;
    This provides a backup to ensure the detail's contents display with a
    background colour, by colouring a child div element which these browser
    can properly calculate size and position. Without this the content is
    displayed with no background colour, and it is hard for a user to decipher
    what text belows to the detail element.

 3. padding: 0.5rem 1rem 0;
    This provides extra spacing around the text within the panel so it doesn't
    hit the background coloured edge.

 Both sets of rules use CSS tricks to determine the browser. If these fail, a
 JavaScript function could run on each page to determine the browser, or the
 Django system could check the browser and include an optional file with these
 rules.
