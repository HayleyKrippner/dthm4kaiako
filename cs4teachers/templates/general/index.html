            This website is still in development as we continue to add features and fix bugs, so please bear with us.
            We have released this website in an alpha state to allow you to easily view all events in one central place.

          <p class="mb-0">In the future we plan to add the ability for you to be able to register for events directly on this site with a login, and edit your registration as you wish.</p>
